# Welcome to the MongoDB VM (IaaS) to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore (PaaS) migration lab

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore is a fully managed MongoDB-compatible service with dedicated instances for new and existing MongoDB applications. This architecture offers a familiar vCore setup for MongoDB users, instantaneous scaling, and seamless native integration with Azure services.

In this lab, you will learn how to use Microsoft's Azure Data Studio to migrate your VM running MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore managed service, both offline and online. Azure Data Studio is recommended for migrations of all shapes and sizes. It is backed by scalable cloud compute and supports both offline and online modes. Most importantly, it provides a GUI interface to launch such migrations, enabling even users with no prior MongoDB administration knowledge to lift and shift servers with ease.
